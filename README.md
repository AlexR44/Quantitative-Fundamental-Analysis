# Quantitative Fundamental Analysis of Mining Stocks
## Objective
The analysis notebook included performs a quantitative fundamental analysis of several mining stocks at a microeconomic level by assessing the effectiveness of a mining company's management.The objective is to determine a stock's true value that an investor can compare against the current market price to see whether the security is undervalued or overvalued by other investors.

Historical balance sheets, and income and cashflow statements of several mining companies are retrieved via API and placed in a ProgeSQL database. The data are subseqquently used to carry out a ratio analysis for each company.

The technical details of the files included are as follows:

* A Jupyter Notebook that describes the data import, exploration, cleanup, and CSV export process. The Pandas Library is used to clean and format your dataset.
* A ProgreSQL database that includes the historical data imported.
* A progreSQL query file that summarizes the queries required for analysis. 
* A Jupyter Notebook that performs and illustrates the final data analysis using PyViz and Hvplot to create (six to eight) visualizations of your data (ideally, at least two per question you ask of your data).
* The illustrations are saved in PNG format for ease of distribution purposes and for inclusion in the final presentation and repo's README.md file.
* (Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class).
* A README.md with a summary of major findings, including a heading for each question asked of the data and a short description of the answer and any relevant plots.
